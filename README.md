Data Science for Scientist's Nanodegree Program with Udacity

# Overview
For this project, the dataset from the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey was used to consider three different interesting questions pertaining to this data. The dataset used for this analysis can be accessed at this location: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017. In this project, I applied the CRISP-DM process for performing this analysis, which had the following steps:
1) Business understanding
2) Data understanding
3) Data preparation
4) Modeling
5) Evaluation
6) Deployment

# Questions
Three interesting questions were considered from this dataset:
- Question 1: How likely is someone to program as a hobby or contribute to open source projects, based on their current professional status?
- Question 2: If someone responded that they don't care what they work on as long as they are paid well, what is their reported salary?
- Question 3: For respondents who have finished college, how does job satisfaction depend on level of formal education?
